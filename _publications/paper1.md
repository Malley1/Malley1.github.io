title: "Scale-Dependent Contributors to River Profile Geometry"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/paper1
excerpt: 'We transformed observed and synthetic longitudinal river profiles into the spectral domain with a view to interrogating the different scales at which fluvial landscapes are generated. Results suggested that river profile geometries are scale-dependent and using small-scale observations to develop a general understanding of large-scale landscape evolution is not straightforward.'
